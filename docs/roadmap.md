# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Add richer type algebra (unions, generic symbolic kinds).
- Add source-level formatting/linting for canonical ICL style.
- Improve parse recovery with grouped diagnostics.

## Mid Term
- Add backend for Rust and C with feature-gated emission.
- Expand optimizer passes (CFG simplification, copy propagation).
- Introduce graph schema migration/version compatibility tooling.

## Long Term
- Intent-preserving reverse compiler from target code to ICL subset.
- AI-assisted template expansion plugins with deterministic fallback.
- Constraint-driven synthesis from natural language intent into ICL.
